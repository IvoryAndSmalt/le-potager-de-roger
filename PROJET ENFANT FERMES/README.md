This package installs a basic file structure for a simple MVC-modeled website.
It has no dependencies and doesn't rely on any library.

The required actions to make your website work with this structure are:
-creating a database
-modifying and renaming the env.example.php file, according to your database information.
-setting up a web server

If you have any enquiries related to the package itself, please contact me at lucas@lucasvandenberg.fr, specifying the package version you have issues with. 
Version can be found in the package.json file, in the "version" field.
